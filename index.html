				<h3>University Profile</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="university-description">
				<p>
					University occupies an important position in the academic scenario of the State of Odisha and
					India. As an institution of higher learning it has become a catalyzing factor of social change in a
					relatively underdeveloped region of the Odisha. For the last fifty-two years it has remained
					committed
					to the pursuit of academic excellence and has earned credibility among the stakeholders. Having
					obtained
					from the NAAC an impressive A Grade and CGPA of 3.15 in its second cycle of re-accreditation and
					occupying a position within the first 150 universities in the NIRF ranking, notwithstanding its
					insufficient infrastructure and funding, this university proves that a creditable performance can be
					achieved in the midst of adversity. This is an affiliating university, with 240 colleges still under
					its
					jurisdiction which is spread over as many as 10 districts of Odisha. Hence it is entrusted with the
					responsibility of educating over 90,000 students. Veritably, a mighty oak grown from a tiny acorn,
					this
					institution has come a long way. Back in 1967, it was a tiny institution, functioning at Patna
					House,
					Sambalpur. The campus at Jyoti Vihar, Burla, was built a decade later, and the academic,
					administrative
					as well as residential buildings for students and faculties came up in course of time. The campus at
					Jyoti Vihar is endowed with lush green woodlands and a peaceful atmosphere that is conducive to
					learning.
